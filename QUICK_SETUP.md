# ðŸš€ Quick Setup Guide - Notification System

## What I've Fixed

âœ… **Created a working Cloudflare Worker** (`worker.js`) that handles notifications  
âœ… **Fixed Android notification channels** - added proper setup in MainActivity and SynapseApp  
âœ… **Created deployment scripts** and configuration files  
âœ… **Added comprehensive error handling** and logging  

## ðŸŽ¯ Immediate Actions Required

### 1. Deploy the Cloudflare Worker

```bash
# Install Wrangler CLI
npm install -g wrangler

# Login to Cloudflare
wrangler login

# Deploy the worker
./deploy.sh production
```

### 2. Set Your OneSignal REST API Key

```bash
# Get your key from OneSignal Dashboard â†’ Settings â†’ Keys & IDs
wrangler secret put ONESIGNAL_REST_API_KEY --env production
```

### 3. Update Your Android App

The notification channels are now automatically created when your app starts. No additional code changes needed!

## ðŸ”§ How It Works Now

1. **Android App** â†’ Sends notification request to Cloudflare Worker
2. **Cloudflare Worker** â†’ Receives request and forwards to OneSignal
3. **OneSignal** â†’ Delivers push notification to user's device
4. **User** â†’ Receives notification with proper sound, vibration, and lights

## ðŸ“± Notification Features

- **High Priority**: Messages get immediate attention
- **Custom Channel**: Dedicated "Messages" channel for chat notifications
- **Rich Notifications**: Lights, vibration, and custom colors
- **Smart Suppression**: No notifications when user is actively chatting

## ðŸ§ª Test the System

```bash
# Test with curl (replace with your actual worker URL)
curl -X POST https://your-worker.your-subdomain.workers.dev \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "recipientUserId": "test-player-id",
    "notificationMessage": "Test notification"
  }'
```

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting

### If notifications don't work:

1. **Check Cloudflare Worker logs**: `wrangler tail`
2. **Verify OneSignal API key**: Check your dashboard
3. **Test worker endpoint**: Use the curl command above
4. **Check Android logs**: Look for OneSignal and notification errors

### Common issues:

- **"Server configuration error"** â†’ Set the OneSignal REST API key secret
- **"Failed to send notification"** â†’ Check your OneSignal app ID and API key
- **No notification sound** â†’ Ensure notification channel is created (should be automatic now)

## ðŸ“‹ Files Created/Modified

- `worker.js` - Cloudflare Worker for notifications
- `wrangler.toml` - Worker configuration
- `package.json` - Node.js dependencies
- `deploy.sh` - Deployment script
- `MainActivity.java` - Added notification channels
- `SynapseApp.java` - Added notification channels
- `README.md` - Comprehensive documentation

## ðŸŽ‰ You're All Set!

Your notification system should now work perfectly. The worker will handle all the heavy lifting, and your Android app will automatically create the proper notification channels.
